# Digital-Logic-in-Action-Controlling-a-Garage-Door-with-FSM
This Verilog project demonstrates the principles of digital design by implementing a finite state machine (FSM) to control an automatic garage door. The controller manages both the up and down motors, adhering to the fundamental rules of digital circuit design.
